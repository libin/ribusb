This is RibUSB, a Ruby extension giving full access to the libusb library, API version 1.0.



INSTALLATION

In order to install RibUSB from source code, you need a working Ruby installation, including its
header files and build utilities (on Debian and Ubuntu systems, part the ruby-dev package). Also,
you need a C compiler (usually gcc), and make. The libusb-1.0 library along with its header files
must naturally be present (on Debian and Ubuntu system, install the libusb-1.0-0-dev package).

To install, execute these commands to configure RibUSB and to build it:

  sh extconf.rb
  make

Unless you have built and installed your own private copy of Ruby (as non-root user), become
super user and install the extension:

  make install

From now on, you can use the RibUSB extension from any instance of Ruby on that computer by
"requiring" it from within your Ruby program:

  require "ribusb"

Please browse the documentation on the website for example uses of RibUSB. Have fun.
